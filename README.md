# Basic Web Dev Collection

This repository showcases a collection of web development projects built using fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as modern libraries like React. Each project is designed to reinforce core concepts in layout design, user interaction, and UI/UX composition.

---

## 🚀 Features

-   **Introduced modern frontend development with React**, demonstrating state management (`useState`), component lifecycle (`useEffect`), and performance optimization (`useCallback`) in a practical application.
-   Crafted complete responsive user interfaces using semantic HTML and modular CSS for static projects. Implemented functional elements like search bars, game logic, buttons, and navigation to simulate real-world application behavior.
-   Focused on pixel-perfect design inspired by real platforms like Amazon, with custom styling and component-based layouts. No external frameworks or libraries were used in the basic HTML/CSS/JS projects.

---

## ✅ Important Takeaways

-   **Gained experience with the React ecosystem**, including hooks, state management, component-based architecture, and integration with tools like Vite and Tailwind CSS.
-   Strengthened HTML, CSS, and JS fundamentals through interactive games and e-commerce style UI components.
-   Learned core web design practices—responsive design, flexbox/grid usage, hover states, and DOM manipulation for event-driven programming.
