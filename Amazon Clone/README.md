## Features

The webpage features a fully functional top navigation bar mimicking Amazon’s real interface, complete with a branded logo, precise location selector, language dropdown, search functionality, and dynamic user account and cart sections. Below it, a festive promotional panel spotlights ongoing offers, reinforcing seasonal relevance. The hero section showcases a full-width banner designed to capture attention immediately. The main shop section is organized into eight responsive product boxes—each presenting a clear product image, bold heading, and a compelling "Shop Now" call-to-action, mimicking real-world e-commerce UX. A structured footer closes the experience, containing essential customer links, service options, and company details, staying true to Amazon's brand tone.

This clone is built using only **semantic HTML and clean, modular CSS**—with **no JavaScript, libraries, or frameworks**—to demonstrate core front-end skills in layout, styling, and UI composition.
