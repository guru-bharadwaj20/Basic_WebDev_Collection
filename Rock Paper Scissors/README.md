## Features

The game begins with a vibrant title and a choice section featuring clickable icons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Each player’s score is clearly displayed and updates after every round. Upon selection, the system randomly generates a computer move, compares it with the user’s, updates the result message, and changes the background color based on the outcome. With no need for page refreshes or backend dependencies, the game offers an interactive and responsive experience using just vanilla JavaScript and styled entirely with modular CSS.
